Workout Tracker PWA (Progressive Web App)
=========================================

Files
-----
- index.html     : the app
- manifest.json  : PWA manifest (lets iOS/Android install to Home Screen)

You can open index.html directly in a browser. For full PWA behavior, serve with any static host
(GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

2) Open the site in Safari on iPhone.
3) Share button â†’ Add to Home Screen.
4) It will open fullscreen and work offline.

Progressive overload
--------------------
- Enter sets as you train (exercise, reps, weight). The app groups sets by exercise.
- It compares the current "top set" (highest weight, tie-breaker reps) to your last session
  of the same exercise:
    ðŸ“ˆ means improved (weight or reps), â†’ same, ðŸ“‰ decreased, ðŸ†• new exercise.
- History shows per-exercise trend vs your previous workout.

Backup
------
